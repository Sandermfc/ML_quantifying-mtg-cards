on the master branch, theres a zipped folder containing all the 
card prices seperated into sets.
each card contains "fair trade price" and "best buylist price".

- to extract into the multiple files on linux, use tar -xzvf price-by-set.tar.gz
- json files, once loaded into a variable, are treated like dictionnaries (same thing as a map in c++)
- to do this, use:
##################################
fileName = "12_myFileName.json"

with open(fileName) as file:
	data = json.load(file)
print("Done reading json file for set names.")
##################################
 - Then, to access the data, simply do:
data["cardName"][0]  #for "fair trade price"
data["cardName"][1]  #for "best buylist price"
